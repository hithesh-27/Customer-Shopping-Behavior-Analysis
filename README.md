# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis

​This project demonstrates a full-stack data analysis workflow, leveraging Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and feature engineering, PostgreSQL for complex querying, and Power BI for interactive visualization and deriving actionable business recommendations.

​🎯 Project Goal
​The primary objective was to analyze 3,900 transactional purchases to uncover key customer spending patterns, segmentation opportunities, and product preferences. The findings aim to provide strategic recommendations to boost marketing efficiency and loyalty program effectiveness.

​💻 Technical Workflow & Execution
​1. Data Preparation and Cleaning (Python)
​Initial Handling: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas to inspect the dataset structure, summary statistics, and data types.
​Data Quality: Addressed missing data by imputing 37 null values in the Review Rating column using the median rating specific to each product category.
​Standardization & Feature Engineering:
​Renamed all column headers to snake_case for better readability.
​Created a crucial age_group column by binning customer ages.
​Engineered a purchase_frequency_days column to measure customer recurrence.
​Verified and dropped redundant columns related to discount tracking.

​2. Database Integration & Analysis (PostgreSQL)
​The cleaned data was loaded into a PostgreSQL database, where structured query language (SQL) was used to answer ten detailed business questions, including:
​Calculating total revenue generated by gender (finding males were the dominant revenue source).
​Identifying customers who are high-spenders despite using discounts.
​Pinpointing the top 5 products based on the highest average review rating.
​Segmenting the customer base into New, Returning, and Loyal segments.
​Comparing spend metrics between subscribers and non-subscribers.
​Determining the correlation between being a repeat buyer (more than 5 purchases) and having a subscription.

​3. Visualization and Dashboarding (Power BI)
​The derived SQL results were connected to Power BI to create the Customer Behavior Dashboard, which provides a holistic view of the key metrics, distribution of subscription status, revenue by category, and sales by age group, allowing stakeholders to easily interact with the data.

​✨ Business Recommendations
​Based on the analytical findings, the project concluded with actionable strategies:
​Boost Subscriptions: Focused promotion of exclusive benefits to the 73% of non-subscribers to increase recurring revenue.
​Customer Loyalty Programs: Implementation of a tiered reward system designed to incentivize repeat buyers and transition them into the newly defined "Loyal" segment.
​Product Strategy: Highlighted top-rated products (e.g., Gloves and Sandals) in primary marketing campaigns while reviewing discount policies to balance sales boost with margin control.
